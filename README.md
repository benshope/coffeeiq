# CoffeeIQ

 CoffeeIQ is a simple app that schedules a coffee break with a new coworker each week.  It regularly pairs up team members who donâ€™t know each other well to spread trust and collaboration across your organization.


## TODO
- Make "your org needs to input an auth token" notification work
- Create calendar invite send script
- Add contact/support page
- Keep a record of historical meetings sent to create schedule priority so that users do not get matched again?
- Add CRON endpoint to trigger calendar invites
- Set up CRON job to trigger calendar send endpoint
- Org admin functionality
- Site admin functionality
- Improve home page copy, group page copy (describe what a group is/that calendar invites are sent within a group).
