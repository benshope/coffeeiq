          <div className="description">
            CoffeeIQ is about bringing people together. Our algorithm regularly pairs up team members who don’t know
            each other well to spread trust and collaboration across your organization.

            Katie works in Sales. Marcus works in Engineering. They've worked at the same company together for a year,
            but they've never had a conversation. Sales doesn't talk to Engineering. HR doesn't talk to Marketing.
            Finance doesn't talk to IT Support (unless a laptop is not cooperating). Sometimes, that's just the way it
            is.

            Even with a stellar company culture, it's hard to meet with teammates you don't interact with on a daily
            basis. Either you don't think about reaching out, or you don't know how to spark the conversation.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: 10 }}>
            CoffeeIQ breaks down silos so you can have more genuine interactions (and friendships) across your company.
            Managers love CoffeeIQ because it promotes team culture, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. Teammates
            love CofeeIQ because they can meet with people they normally wouldn't talk to, better understand a person's
            role, or find ways to help each other.
